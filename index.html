<h1>I like beer!</h1>
<h3>What's not to like?</h3>

<p id="first_paragraph">Beer has been around for centuries!  Some historians believe that beer was the product that led our ancestors to settle down from nomadic tribes and begin agricultural communities.  All they had to do was harvest a field of grains to make beer, which seemed pretty easy.
</p>

<p class="other_paragraph">Fast forward to the 21st century.  We have the abundance of all types of grains, and we have international cultural influences to spread all of the different beer styles around the world!
</p>

<p class="other_paragraph">On this website, I will talk about all of the beer styles that I like.  Come on a journey with me!
