<!--Using Git Workflow and a feature branch, create an index.html file in your newly cloned repository. Add in content and HTML to briefly describe your website topic.
Add content to your site (don't forget to commit often to demonstrate Git workflow!). Your site should include
the basic HTML structure elements found on every HTML page
some content that mixes header and paragraph tags
at least one image
at least two block-level elements that give semantic meaning to content
a table or form (you can submit to httpbin if you like, or to the other page of your site)
a list
at least one additional page that is linked from index.html
Find an existing website about your topic (or similar). What makes this site good or bad? Look at the source code (View Source). Do you recognize any HTML elements? Try to guess what the things you don't recognize do. Add a link to this website and a few sentences about what makes it good or bad to your index.html page.
Validate your HTML code with an HTML validator (Links to an external site.).
Update your repository on GitHub using GitHub Workflow.
Navigate to your website in a new browser tab http://<USERNAME>>.github.io to verify that your site is live.
Submit the URL for the site, so we can view your beautiful work!-->

<p style="text-align:center">I'm Justin, and I like lots of things!  One of my favorite things is making beer!!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Making beer is really easy, all you have to do is follow simple directions!  Can you make oatmeal?  Can you boil water?  If you answered yes to both of these questions, then you're already skilled enough to make your own beer!</p>



<P>Here are some simple instructions on how to make beer!
	<ol>
		<li>Mash the grains in warm water to release the sugars</li>
		<li>Sparge, or rinse the grains with warm water into a large pot</li>
		<li>Boil your newly created wort with hops</li>
		<li>Cool it down and transfer it to a fermenting vessel</li>
		<li>Ferment for two weeks with yeast</li>
		<li>Bottle and enjoy!</li>
	</ol></P>


<p>And here are some <em>recipes</em> that I like!</p>
